            <p>
              Situated in the quaint village of Jharipani, about 7 km from the
              city centre of Mussoorie, is the stunning Jharipani Falls. Its
              charm lies in its secluded location that is not marred by touristy
              crowds yet. You can spend hours soaking in the beauty of the
              falls, clicking good pictures or simply appreciating the views of

              range. You will also find rare varieties of flowers in bloom at
              the site. The route to the falls is simple and can be easily

              literally translates to Red Hill, which is a direct reference to

              No trip to Mussoorie is complete without visiting the much-famed

              the pool formed at the bottom of the fall, click some pictures, or
